{"name":"Sinan","body":"What is Sinan\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nSinan is a build tool designed to build Erlang/OTP Projects, Releases\r\nand Applications. Sinan leverages the metadata artifacts provided by\r\nOTP to do a good job building, testing, releasing, etc with very\r\nlittle or no additional input from the developer.\r\n\r\nGetting Sinan\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nBy far the easiest way to get sinan is to download it from the\r\n[downloads site](https://github.com/erlware/sinan/downloads).\r\n\r\nMore Information and FAQ\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSinan has extensive further documentation in its\r\n[wiki on github](https://github.com/erlware/sinan/wiki). Check there\r\nfor more information.\r\n\r\nThe Sinan FAQ is available at\r\n[here](https://github.com/erlware/sinan/wiki/FAQ).\r\n\r\n### The Community\r\n\r\nA community exists around Sinan and the other Erlware projects. You\r\nmay participate in the community and ask questions by joining the\r\n[erlware-questions](http://groups.google.com/group/erlware-questions)\r\nmailing list.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuick Start\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nTo get started just cd into an OTP Application and type\r\n\r\n    sinan build\r\n\r\nThis will give you an fully built OTP application under the _build\r\ndirectory. You can then run the command\r\n\r\n    sinan shell\r\n\r\nto get an erlang shell with all the paths pointing correctly to the\r\nvarious parts of your system.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get adventurous you can run all the eunit tests in your\r\napp by running:\r\n\r\n    sinan test\r\n\r\nand finially, if you want to package up a normal erlang release\r\ntarball you can run\r\n\r\n    sinan dist\r\n\r\nThe tarball will end up in\r\n\r\n    <project-root>/_build/<release-name>/tar/<app-name>-<app-vsn>.tar.gz\r\n\r\nTo get a list of all tasks currently available run the command\r\n\r\n    sinan help\r\n\r\nHopefully thats enough to get you started, but sinan has many options\r\nto do various things with projects from small single app projects to\r\nvery large multiple app projects. To get more information take a look\r\nat the sinan manual.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Erlang/OTP oriented build system","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
