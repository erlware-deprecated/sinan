The Xref Task
=============
Eric Merritt <ericbmerritt@gmail.com>


The Xref task runs the http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/xref.html[Xref
tool] (amazingly enough). The easiest way by far to understand what
the Xref task does is to read the documentation and the manual page
for that tool.

In a nut shell it provides a specific set of errors and and warnings
about things the erlang compiler generally does not warn about. These
warnings include things like calling functions that do not exist, and
functions that are defined but never used. At its most basic it is a
cross referencing tool.

You may run the tool as follows.

[source,sh]
