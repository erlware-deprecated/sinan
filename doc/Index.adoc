What is Sinan
-------------

Sinan is a build tool designed to build SinanProjects and
OTPApplications, Releases and Applications. Sinan leverages the
metadata artifacts provided by OTP to do a good job building, testing,
releasing, etc with very little or no additional input from the
developer.

Quick start
-----------

Lets start by generate a project with a single application. Sinan has
the gen task and this allows you to generate a buildable skeleton for
your new project. It wont do much, but it will give you an idea of how
sinan works.

Lets call our new project foo. On the command line type the following
code.

Generating the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Generate the foo project
[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  $> sinan gen foo
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This will take you through a series of quetions about yourself and the
project. I have provided a series of answers here, that illustrate how
to answer these questions.

 Project was created, you should be good to go!
----------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example we are going to generate a project with only one OTP
application. The gen system needs to know a bit of information about
you, your name, who is going to hold the copyright, the project
version etc. For now, leave the erts version as is, you can do that by
just hitting enter after the promyt. This is a very simple project so
we don't need a build config either. Just enter 'n' after that
request.

Building our new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we have a project. Take a look and poke around. It should look
something like this

.The generated project
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
foo
 |-- bin
 |-- config
 |-- doc
 |-- ebin
 |    |-- foo.app
 |    `-- overview.edoc
 |-- include
 `-- src
      |-- foo_app.erl
      `-- foo_sup.erl
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As your project grows you will have more source files, documentation
etc. Thats to be expected. but lets get onto the more fun things. Lets
build the project.

.Build with sinan
[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  $> cd <my foo directory>
  $> sinan build
----------------------------------------------------------------------

cd into the top level of the project and run sinan build. This first
time its important that you do it from the top level.

.The built project
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
foo
 |-- _build
 |   `-- development
 |       |-- apps
 |       |   `-- foo-0.11.0
 |       |       |-- bin
 |       |       |-- config
 |       |       |-- doc
 |       |       |-- ebin
 |       |       |   |-- foo.app
 |       |       |   |-- foo_app.beam
 |       |       |   |-- foo_sup.beam
 |       |       |   `-- overview.edoc
 |       |       |-- include
 |       |       `-- src
 |       |           |-- foo_app.erl
 |       |           `-- foo_sup.erl
 |       |-- info
 |       |   |-- deps
 |       |   `-- repoapps
 |       `-- sig
 |           |-- dep
 |           |   `-- _Users_emerritt_tmp_foo_ebin_foo.app.sig
 |           `-- erldeps
 |               |-- _Users_emerritt_tmp_foo_src_foo_app.erl.sig
 |               `-- _Users_emerritt_tmp_foo_src_foo_sup.erl.sig
 |-- bin
 |-- config
 |-- doc
 |-- ebin
 |   |-- foo.app
 |   `-- overview.edoc
 |-- include
 `-- src
     |-- foo_app.erl
     `-- foo_sup.erl
----------------------------------------------------------------------

One thing to notice here immediately is that there is a new directory
called +_build+. Sinan never, ever touches your the source files in
your root directory. It creates a version of the directory under build
and does all of its changes there.

For the most part you can ignore the +info+ and +sig+ directories. The
ones of interest to us right now is the app directory. If you look
there you will see that we have a fully deployable version of our app,
with the version number postpended just like erlang wants. We have all
of our source built into ebin and the source in src (OTP applications
are almost always distributed with source).

Thats the build comand, but sinan can do a bunch more. Lets explore
some of the other commands.

Testing the project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sinan has the ability to run eunit tests in a project and
automatically generates code coverage reports for those tests. Lets
add a test to the application behavior (foo_app.erl) file and run our
new tests. Currently the app file looks as follows.

.The current Application Behavior (foo_app.erl) file

                       {error, Reason::any()}.
 start(_StartType, _StartArgs) ->
     case foo_sup:start_link() of
         {ok, Pid} ->
             {ok, Pid};
         Error ->

 -spec stop(State::any()) -> ok.
 stop(_State) ->
     ok.

 %%%===================================================================
 %%% Internal functions
 %%%===================================================================
----------------------------------------------------------------------

For now we are just going to add a test section and a single test that
doesn't do much that is very interesting.

First we need to import the eunit header (don't worry sinan makes sure
its avaibale). Then we can add a test section right below the internal
functions section.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice the +include_lib+ belowe the +export+ and the new function
+something_test+ in the tests section. Now that we have built once you
can be anywhere under the build dir and sinan will know how to find
everything.

.Running sinan test
[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  $> sinan test
 starting: build
 Building /Users/emerritt/tmp/foo/src/foo_app.erl
 starting: test
 Testing foo
 foo_app:  Test passed.
 foo_sup:  There were no tests to run.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

We can see that we had a test in foo_app and that our test passed with
no problems. Sinan has added somethings to the +_build+ area to give
us some more information about things like code coverage and test
results.

.Test task output
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |-- _build
 |   `-- development
 |       |-- docs
 |       |   `-- coverage
 |       |       `-- foo
 |       |           |-- coverage_index.html
 |       |           |-- foo_app.html
 |       |           |-- foo_sup.html
 |       |           `-- index.html
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Everything that was in build is still there. I have cut out all the
stuff you have already seen so we can focus on the test output. When
sinan runs test code it also outputs code coverage reports. Those code
coverage reports go into the <bulid-area>/docs/coverage
folder. +coverage_index.html+ is the place you want to go look with
your browser to see these coverage reports.

Creating an OTP release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creating a release for OTP manually can be a pain in the butt. Sinan,
however, makes it trivial. We just need to run the sinan rel task to
get all of the rel, build, and script artifacts.

Lets do that now

.Running the sinan release task
[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 $> sinan release
 starting: depends
 starting: build
 starting: release
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There isn't much to look at in the output of the release task, but
there are some new interesting things in the +_build+ area. Lets take
a look at that.

.Generated release information
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 |-- _build
 |   `-- development
 |       |-- releases
 |       |   `-- foo-0.11.0
 |       |       |-- foo.boot
 |       |       |-- foo.rel
 |       |       |-- foo.script
 |       |       `-- sys.config
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once again everything that was there remains there, I have just cut
down the example to new items. Sinan has generated all of the release
artifacts for your new project by looking in your OTP lib dir. In fact
it has also generated the release files as well.

The *.rel file is by far the most interesting. Lets take a look at
what sinan generated.

.Generated release information
[source,erlang]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 {release,{"foo","0.11.0"},
          {erts,"5.8.2"},
          [{eunit,"2.1.6"},
           {foo,"0.11.0"},
           {kernel,"2.14.2"},
           {stdlib,"1.17.2"}]}.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a good, fully expanded release file with all the current
dependencies, and with those dependencies resolved.

Finially, we want to distribute this wonderful project to other
folks. Of course, OTP provides the framework, but sinan knows how to
do the work for you. Lets look at that.

Creating an OTP distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The dist task is much like the release task. It doesn't have much
output but it does create artifacts in +_build+ that we care
about. Lets run dist now and see what happens.

.Running the sinan dist task
[source,sh]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 $> sinan dist
 starting: depends
 starting: build
 starting: release
 starting: dist
----------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see, not much output, but the real interesting stuff is in
the +_build+ directory.

.The dist task output
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
|-- _build
|   `-- development
|       `-- tar
|           `-- foo-0.11.0.tar.gz
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can see that we have a tarball now that contains the a fully
deployable distribution of the project.

Lets look at the distribution tarball. I have left off the application
dir contents in the interests of berevity.

.The distribution tarball contents
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
`-- foo-0.11.0
    |-- bin
    |-- lib
    |   |-- eunit-2.1.6
    |   |-- foo-0.11.0
    |   |-- kernel-2.14.2
    |   `-- stdlib-1.17.2
    `-- releases
        `-- foo-0.11.0
            |-- foo.boot
            |-- foo.rel
            `-- foo.script
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a normal OTP distribution tarball with all of the dependencies included.

Sinan has a few more commands and things can get much more complex if
you need them to be. If you need further help you can always run the
sinan help command.

.The sinan help command
[source,txt]
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 $> sinan help
starting: help
depends
   Analyzes all of the dependencies in the project and pulls down
   those that arn't curently available locally

version
   Provides sinan server version information

test
   Runs all of the existing eunit unit tests in the project

shell
   Starts an erlang shell with all of the correct paths preset so the
   developer can noodle with the code to his hearts content

release
   Creates the *.rel, *.boot and *.script into the
   <build-area>/realeases/<vsn> directory. It also builds up a release
   tar bal into the <build-area>/tar/ directory

help
   Provides help information for the available tasks

gen
   Generates a buildable default project layout

doc
   Runs edoc across all sources in the project and outputs it into the
   build area

dist
   Creates an tarball of the distribution including release
   information. Check documentation for the dist task for
   configuration information

clean
   Removes the build area and everything underneath

build
   Compiles all of the compilable files in the project

----------------------------------------------------------------------

don't rely on the output here too much, go ahead and run help for
yourself. The output changes and (hopefully) becomes more useful over
time.

Other Helpful Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are quite a few other tasks that it is useful to be aware of.

- The XrefTask: A task that runs the xref tool
